<h3>Different types of pears</h3>
<p>There are loads of different types of pears! Apparently over 5,000 varieties.  


<h3>Fun Things to do with Pears</h3>
	<p>Thought pears were just for eating? Well you couldn't be more wrong.  Here are a few fun ideas of things you can do with pears </p>

	<!--<p>Why not try taking two different types of pear and splicing them together to make a HybridPear.  We've tried it with a green conference pear and a red blush pear.</p> 

	<p>Pears make great friends.  Give your pear facial features and accessories to make him into a fun character.  Then create friends and family members to keep your pear company and expand your pear community.  </p> -->

<p>I'm making a small change so I can commit it to the repository</p>
